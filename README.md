# PN5180 multicard lib

## THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

This library aims to allow you to enumerate all cards in the readers field, and to select which one you want to interact with.
It is also supposed to support Low-Power-Card-Detection mode, so you can build power-saving applications.

The goal is for the library to interact with the underlying hardware through callbacks, so this code can be used on any platform.
